# COMPE-375 Project 2
The program repeatedly prints my RedID followed by /r and /n characters “826559013\r\n” into a PuTTY terminal, with a delay of 500ms. This program runs continuously in an infinite loop by having the main function call a separate function to transmit each character one by one until it reaches the end of the string.	
## Main algorithm/logic
The “uart_init()” functions contains initialization processes to ensure the proper settings for receiving and transmitting data with UART. The “uart_transmit” function contains a single while loop that waits for the USART data register to be free before loading any data to this register. Finally, the “main()” function calls the “uart_init()” function once, and repeatedly calls a while loop, which calls the “uart_transmit()” function to transmit each character of the array “redID” until it reaches the end of the string. There is a 500ms delay before again calling this while loop.
