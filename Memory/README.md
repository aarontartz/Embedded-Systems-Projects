# COMPE-375 Project 8
This program increases the brightness of the LED from 0% to 100% in 10% intervals every time the AVR board is plugged and unplugged back in. It does this by storing the “duty” variable to non-volatile memory, EEPROM, which means it can store data even while the board has no power supplied to it. Volatile memory on the other hand, loses its data once it loses power. To set a 5ms PWM waveform, the OCR0A value was calculated using a 1024 value prescaler. To increase the brightness, the duty variable is divided by 100, then multiplied by OCR0A to get the OCR0B value once the new data is written to EEPROM. This program also uses a timer and interrupts to turn on and off the LED while the program is running.
## Main algorithm/logic
The main function first calls the initialization function, which initializes the output to the LED and initializes timer 0. After calling this initialization function, the “duty” variable is read from EEPROM at the address stored in “address.” This address does not matter, as long as it is still a valid address to be read and written from. It then checks to see if the duty variable is less than 100, in which case it will add 10 to the duty variables to increase the LED brightness by 10%. However, once the duty variable reaches 100, it resets back to 0. This new duty variable is then written into the same address that it was read from, so for the next cycles it can be repeatedly updated. The OCR0B variable is then updated to allow the LED to physically change brightness, where then sei() is called to enable the interrupts to show the new brightness of the LED.
